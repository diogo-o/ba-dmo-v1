# Boquilhas — operational acceptance

## VISUAL

- Capture the authority and implementation at the identical viewport and state.
- Produce an overlay/diff and correct every unexplained discrepancy.
- Verify hierarchy, section order, tabs, sidebars, cards, controls, responsive composition and visible states.

## VIEWPORTS

- 1440×900
- 980×900
- 720×900
- 375×812

## STATES

- Populated
- Selected
- Empty
- Loading
- Error
- Dialog/edit where applicable
- Mobile first screen

## FUNCTIONAL

**VERIFICATION:** Movement/discrepancy/close regressions; screenshot comparison for every tab/state at all viewports.  
**FUNCTIONAL REGRESSION CRITERIA:** 20→25 remains non-blocking and BQ schema/domain stays independent.  

Additionally prove the critical local rule in `00_README.md` and run the existing relevant regression tests.

## NEGATIVE

- None of the local **MUST NOT** or **DO NOT USE** items appears or occurs.
- No demo IDs/data/logic, client business calculation, invented workflow, temporary layout or schema-driven redesign is introduced.
- No page-level horizontal scrolling occurs at any required viewport.
